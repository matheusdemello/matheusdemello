## üìå About Me

I am a computational physicist with extensive expertise in **computational modeling**, **AI engineering**, and **high-performance computing (HPC)**, bridging the gap between fundamental physics and applied, data-driven solutions.

Initially focused on **atomistic simulations**, **quantum materials modeling**, and **theoretical physics**, particularly complex soft-matter systems like liquid crystals, I have transitioned my analytical and computational skills toward **geospatial data processing**, **3D modeling**, and **renewable energy analysis**.
